          Hello! I am an experienced Business Analyst with a strong interest in
          project management and data analysis. Over the years, I have supported
          multiple projects from planning to execution, coordinating with teams,
          and ensuring smooth delivery of outcomes. My experience has given me a
          clear understanding of how to break down complex requirements and
          manage timelines effectively.

        <p className="pt-4 text-justify indent-6">
          Over time, I realised that understanding the data behind every
          decision could make my work even more impactful. This led me to learn
          SQL and Power BI which opened up a new side of my work. I started
          writing my own queries, playing with the data, creating dashboards and
          quickly spotting patterns using SQL and Power BI. I even completed the
          HackerRank Advanced SQL Certification, which strengthened my
          confidence in writing more queries.
        </p>

          But I didn't just stop at data. I have always been curious about how
          websites and apps are built. So, I started learning React JS and
          Tailwind CSS out of pure interest. React felt a bit overwhelming at
          first, but I stuck with it and slowly things started to make sense. It
          was fun experimenting and I ended up building a few small projects -
          nothing too big, but enough to teach me how things work on the front
          end. For me, learning something new and trying it out hands-on has
          always been the best way to grow. This portfolio is just a mix of my
          work, my experiments, and everything I have been exploring along the
          way.
